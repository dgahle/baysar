    Examples:
        - Hydrogen recombination rates `adf11: str = get_adf11(element='h', adf11type='acd', year=12)`.
        - Lithium ionisation rates resolved by metastables `adf11: str = get_adf11(element='li', adf11type='scd', year=93, resolved=True)`
        - Carbon charge exchange rates resolved by metastables `adf11: str = get_adf11(element='c', adf11type='ccd', resolved=True)`
        - Nitrogen ionisation rates `adf11: str = get_adf11(element='n', adf11type='scd')`

    :param (str) element:
        Element abbreviation for the requested data (lower case). For example hydrogen is 'h' and lithium is 'li'.
    :param (str) adf11type:
        Three letter code for the types of data (lower case):
            'acd' - Recombination
            'scd' - Ionisation
            'xcd' - Spin change within a charge state
            'qcd' - Spin change within a charge state via the z+1 charge state
            'ccd' - Charge-exchange
            'plt' - Total excitation line radiative power
            'prb' - Total recombination radiative power (line, recombination continuum, and bremsstrahlung)
            'prc' - Line power from thermal neutral hydrogen-ion charge exchange
            'pls' - Line radiative power of selected transitions of key ions
    :param (int) year: 96
        Reference year for the data. Most ADF11 files will have year 93 and 96 versions. Hydrogen ACD and SCD files
        have year 12 data. Broadly the newer data is "better" as it is created to overcome limitations in the older
        data.
    :param (bool) resolved: False
        Metastable resolution of the GCR model used to calculate the data.
